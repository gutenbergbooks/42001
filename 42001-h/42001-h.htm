<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>A PLEA FOR THE CITY CHURCHES.</h3>

  <p>When a bachelor is found wandering about, he cares not whither, your
  fair readers (for doubtless such a "dealer in curiosities" as you are has
  many of that sex who, however unjustly, have the credit of the "curious"
  bump) will naturally exclaim "he must be in love," or "something horrible
  has happened to him." Let us, however, disappoint them by assuring them
  we shall keep our own counsel. If the former be the cause, green lanes
  and meandering streams would suit his case better than Gracechurch
  Street, London, with the thermometer five or six degrees below freezing
  point, and the snow (!) the colour and consistency of chocolate. Such a
  situation, however, was ours, when our friend the Incumbent of Holy
  Trinity, Minories, accosted us. He was going to his church; would we
  accompany him? We would have gone to New Zealand with him, if he had
  asked us, at that moment. The <i>locale</i> of the Minories was nearly as
  unknown to us as the aforesaid flourishing colony. On entering the church
  (which will <i>not</i> repay an architectural zealot), while our friend
  was extracting a burial register, our eye fell on an old monument or two.
  There was a goodly Sir John Pelham, who had been cruelly cut down by the
  hand of death in 1580, looking gravely at his sweet spouse, a dame of the
  noble house of Bletsoe. Behind him is kneeling his little son and heir
  Oliver, whom, as the inscription informs us, "Death enforced to follow
  fast" his papa, as he died in 1584.</p>

  <p>And there was a stately monument of the first Lord Dartmouth, a
  magnanimous hero, and Master of the Ordnance to Charles II. and his
  renegade brother. We were informed that a gentlemen in the vestry had
  come for the certificate of the burial of Viscount Lewisham, who died
  some thirty years ago; that the Legge family were all buried here; that
  after having dignified the aristocratic parish of St. George, Hanover
  Square, and the <i>salons</i> of May Fair, during life, they were content
  to lie quietly in the Minories! Does not the <i>high blood</i> of the
  "city merchant" of the present clay, of the "gentleman" of the Stock
  Exchange, curdle at the thought? Yes, there lie many a noble heart, many
  a once beautiful face but we must now-a-days, forsooth, forget the City
  as soon as we have made our money in its dirty alleys. To lie there after
  death! pooh, the thought is absurd. (Thanks to Lord Palmerston, we have
  no option now.)</p>

  <p>Well, we were then asked by the worthy Incumbent, "Would you not like
  to see my head?" Did he take us for a Lavater or a Spurzheim? However, we
  were not left in suspense long, for out of the muniment closet was
  produced a tin box; we thought of Reading biscuits, but we were
  undeceived shortly. Taken out carefully and gently, was produced a human
  head! No mere skull, but a perfect human head! Alas! its wearer had lost
  it in an untimely hour. Start not, fair reader! we often lose our heads
  and hearts too, but not, we hope, in the mode our poor friend did. It was
  clear a choice had been given to him, but it was a Hobson's choice. He
  had been <i>axed</i> whether he would or no! He had been decapitated! We
  were told that now ghastly head had once been filled with many an
  anxious, and perhaps happy, thought. It had had right royal ideas. It was
  said to be the head of Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, the father of the
  sweet Lady Jane Grey. We could muse and moralise; but Captain Cuttle cuts
  us short, "When found, make a Note of it." We found it then there, Sir;
  will you make the Note? The good captain does not like to be prolix. Has
  his esteemed old relative, Sylvanus Urban (many happy new years to him!),
  made the note before?</p>

  <p>We came away, shall we say better in mind? Yes, said we, a walk in the
  City may be as instructive, and as good a cure for melancholy, as the
  charming country. An old city church can tell its tale, and a good one
  too. We thought of those quaint old monuments, handed down from older
  churches 'tis true, but still over the slumbering ashes of our
  forefathers; and when the thought of the destroying hand that hung over
  them arose amid many associations, the Bard of Avon's fearful monumental
  denunciation came to our aid:</p>

<h3>AMBIGUITY IN PUBLIC WRITING.</h3>

  <p>In Brenan's <i>Composition and Punctuation</i>, published by Wilson,
  Royal Exchange, he strongly condemns <i>the one</i> and <i>the other</i>,
  as used for <i>the former</i> and <i>the latter</i>, or <i>the first</i>
  and <i>the last</i>. The understood rule is, that <i>the one</i> refers
  to the nearest or <i>latter</i> person or thing mentioned, and <i>the
  other</i> to the farthest or <i>former</i>; and if that were strictly
  adhered to, no objection could be raised. But I have found, from careful
  observation for two or three years past, that some of our standard
  writers reverse the rule, and use <i>the one</i> for <i>the former</i>,
  and <i>the other</i> for <i>the latter</i>, by which I have often been
  completely puzzled to know what they meant in cases of importance. Now,
  since there is not the slightest chance of unanimity here, I think the
  author is right in condemning their referential usage altogether. A
  French grammarian says, "Ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas Français;" but
  though French is far from having no ambiguities, he showed that he fully
  appreciated what ought to be the proudest boast of any language,
  clearness. There is a notable want of it on the marble tablet under the
  portico of St. Paul's, Covent Gardens, which says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The church of this parish having been destroyed by fire on the 17th
  day of September, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1795, was rebuilt, and
  opened for divine service on the 1st day of August, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1798."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The writer, no doubt, congratulated himself on avoiding the then
  common error, in similar cases, of "<i>This</i> church having," &amp;c.;
  for that asserted, that the very building we were looking at was burned
  down! But in eschewing one manifest blunder, he fell into ambiguity, and
  inconclusiveness equally reprehensible. For, as it never was imperative
  that a parish church should be <i>always</i> confined to a particular
  spot, we are left in doubt as to where the former one stood; nor, indeed,
  are we told whether the present building is the parish church. Better
  thus: "The church of this parish, <i>which stood on the present site</i>,
  having," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Even with this change another seems necessary, for we should then be
  virtually informed, as we are now, that the church was rebuilt, and
  opened for divine service, <i>in one day</i>!<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Such is the care requisite, when
  attempting comprehensive brevity, for the simplest historical record
  intended to go down to posterity. It is no answer to say, that every one
  apprehends what the inscription means, for that would sanction all kinds
  of obscurity and blunders. When Paddy tells us of <i>wooden</i> panes of
  glass and mile-stones; of dividing a thing into three halves; of backing
  a carriage straight forwards, or of a dismal solitude where nothing could
  be heard but silence, we all perfectly understand what he means, while we
  laugh at his unconscious union of sheer impossibilities.</p>

<h3>A CAROL OF THE KINGS.</h3>

  <p>According to one legend, the three sons of Noah were raised from the
  dead to represent all mankind at Bethlehem. According to another, they
  slept a deep sleep in a cavern on Ararat until Messias was born, and then
  an angel aroused and showed them The Southern Cross, then first created
  to be the beacon of their way.</p>

  <p>When the starry signal had fulfilled its office it went on, journeying
  towards the south, until it reached its place to bend above The Peaceful

<h3>SIR W. SCOTT AND SIR W. NAPIER.</h3>

  <p>Some short time ago there appeared in <i>The Times</i> certain letters
  relative to a song of Sir Walter Scott in disparagement of Fox, said to
  have been sung at the dinner given in Edinburgh on the acquittal of
  Viscount Melville. In one letter, signed "W. Napier," it is asserted, on
  the authority of a lady, that Scott <i>sang</i> the song, which gave
  great offence to the Whig party at the time.</p>

  <p>Now, I must take the liberty of declaring this assertion to be
  incorrect. I had the honour of knowing pretty intimately Sir Walter from
  the year 1817 down to the period of his departure for the Continent. I
  have been present at many convivial meetings with him, and conversed with
  him times without number, and he has repeatedly declared that, although
  fond of music, he could not sing from his boyhood, and could not even hum
  a tune so as to be intelligible to a listener. The idea, therefore, of
  his making such a public exhibition of himself as to sing at a public
  meeting, is preposterous.</p>

  <p>But in the next place the cotemporary evidence on the subject is
  conclusive. An account of the dinner was published in the <i>Courant</i>
  newspaper, and it is there stated "that <i>one</i> song was sung, the
  poetry of which was said to come from the muse of 'the last lay,' and was
  sung with admirable effect by the proprietor of the <i>Ballantyne
  Press</i>."</p>

  <p>It is perhaps unnecessary to explain that the singer was the late John
  Ballantyne, and I have my doubts if the song referred to in the
  controversy was the one sung upon the occasion. This, however, is merely
  a speculation arising from the fact, that this was a song not included in
  Sir Walter Scott's works, which upon the very highest authority I have
  been informed was sung there, but of which Lord Ellenborough, and not
  Charles Fox, was the hero. It is entitled "Justice Law," and is highly
  laudatory of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It has been printed in the
  <i>Supplement to the Court of Session Garland</i>, p. 10., and the
  concluding verse is as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then here's to the prelate of wisdom and fame,</p>
      <p>Tho' true Presbyterians we'll drink to his name;</p>
      <p>Long, long, may he live to teach prejudice awe,</p>
      <p>And since Melville's got justice, the devil take law."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Again I repeat this conjecture may be erroneous; but that Sir Walter
  never sung any song at all at the meeting is, I think, beyond
  dispute.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Sign of Rain.</i>&mdash;Not far from Weobley, co. Hereford, is a
  high hill, on the top of which is a clump of trees called "Ladylift
  Clump," and thus named in the Ordnance map: it is a proverbial expression
  in the surrounding neighbourhood, that when this clump is obscured with
  clouds, wet weather soon follows, connected with which, many years since
  I met with the following lines, which may prove interesting to many of
  your readers:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3hg3">"When Ladie Lift</p>
      <p class="i3">Puts on her shift,</p>

      <p>But when she doffs it, you will finde</p>
      <p>The raine is o'er, and still the winde,</p>
      <p class="i1">And Ph&oelig;bus Sloane againe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>What is the origin of this name having been given to the said clump of
  trees?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. B. Whitborne.</span></p>

  <p><i>Communications with Iceland.</i>&mdash;In the summer of 1851 I
  directed attention to the communications with Iceland. I am just informed
  that the Danish government will send a war steamer twice next summer to
  the Faroe Islands and to Iceland, <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>calling at Leith both
  ways for passengers. The times of sailing will probably be announced
  towards spring in the public prints. This opportunity of visiting that
  strange and remarkable island in so advantageous a manner is worthy of
  notice, as desirable modes of getting there very rarely occur.</p>

  <p>The observing traveller, in addition to the wonders of nature, should
  not fail to note there the social and physical condition, and diseases of
  the inhabitants. He will there find still lingering, fostered by dirt,
  bad food, and a squalid way of living, the true leprosy (in Icelandic,
  <i>spetalska</i>) which prevailed throughout Europe in the Middle Ages
  and which now survives only there, in Norway, and in some secluded
  districts in central and southern Europe. He will also note the
  remarkable exemption of the Icelanders from pulmonary consumption; a fact
  which seems extraordinary, considering the extreme dampness, inclemency,
  and variability of the climate. But the consumptive tendency is always
  found to cease north of a certain parallel of latitude.</p>

  <p><i>Starvation, an Americanism.</i>&mdash;Strange as it may appear, it
  is nevertheless quite true that this word, now unhappily so common on
  every tongue, as representing the condition of so many of the sons and
  daughters of the sister lands of Great Britain and Ireland, is not to be
  found in <i>our own</i> English dictionaries; neither in Todd's
  <i>Johnson</i>, published in 1826, nor in Richardson's, published ten
  years later, nor in Smart's&mdash;Walker remodelled&mdash;published about
  the same time as Richardson's. It is Webster who has the credit of
  importing it from his country into this; and in a supplement issued a few
  years ago, Mr. Smart adopted it as "a <i>trivial</i> word, but in very
  common, and at present good use."</p>

  <p>What a lesson might Mr. Trench read us, that it should be so!</p>

  <p>Our older poets, to the time of Dryden, used the compound
  "hunger-starved." We now say <i>starved</i> with cold. Chaucer speaks of
  Christ as "He that <i>starf</i> for our redemption," of Creseide "which
  well nigh <i>starf</i> for <i>feare</i>;" Spenser, of arms "which doe men
  in <i>bale</i> to sterve." (See <i>Starve</i> in Richardson.) In the
  <i>Pardoneres Tale</i>, v. 12799:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ye (yea), <i>sterve</i> he shall, and that in lesse while</p>
      <p>Than thou wilt gon a pas not but a mile;</p>
      <p>This <i>poison</i> is so strong and violent."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And again, v. 12822:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10hg3">"It happed him</p>
      <p>To take the botelle there the poison was,</p>

      <p>For which anone they <i>storven</i> bothe two."</p>
    </div>

  <p>Mr. Tyrwhit explains, "to die, to perish" and the general meaning of
  the word was, "to die, or cause to die, to perish, to destroy."</p>

  explore the gigantic tumuli of New Grange, Dowth, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Passing through the village of Monknewtown, about four miles from
  Drogheda, I entered a burial-ground surrounding the ivy-clad ruins of a

<h3>BUONAPARTE'S ABDICATION.</h3>

  <p>A gentleman living in the neighbourhood of London bought a table five
  or six years ago at Wilkinson's, an old established upholsterer on
  Ludgate Hill.</p>

  <p>In a concealed part of the leg of the table he found a brass plate, on
  which was the following inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Le Cinq d'Avril, dix-huit cent quatorze, Napoléon Buonaparte signa
  son abdication sur cette table dans le cabinet de travail du Roi, le 2me
  après la chambre à coucher, à Fontainebleau."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The people at Wilkinson's could give no account of the table: they
  said it had been a long time in the shop; they did not remember of whom
  it had <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>been bought, and were surprised when the
  brass plate was pointed out to them.</p>

  <p>The table is a round one, and rather pretty looking, about two feet
  and a half in diameter, and supported on one leg. It does not look like a
  table used for writing, but rather resembles a lady's work-table. The
  wood with which it is veneered has something the appearance of beef
  wood.</p>

  <p>Wilkinson's shop does not now exist: he used to deal in curiosities,
  and was employed as an auctioneer.</p>

  <p>The gentleman who bought this table is desirous of ascertaining at
  what time the table still shown at Fontainebleau, as that on which the
  abdication was signed, was first exhibited: whether immediately after the
  restoration of the Bourbons, or later, in consequence of a demand for
  shows of that sort? Whether it is a fact that the Bourbons turned out the
  imperial furniture from Fontainebleau and other palaces after their
  return?</p>

  <p>The date, "cinq d'Avril," is wrong; the abdication was signed on the
  4th. This error, however, leads one to suspect that the table is genuine:
  as any one preparing a sham table should have been careful in referring
  to printed documents. From the tenor of the inscription, we may infer
  that it is the work of a Royalist.</p>

  <p>The Marshals present with Napoleon when he signed his abdication were
  Ney, Oudinot, and Lefevre; and perhaps Caulincourt.</p>

<h3>DEATH WARNINGS IN ANCIENT FAMILIES.</h3>

  <p>I marvel much that none of your contributors in this line have touched
  upon a very interesting branch of legendary family folk lore, namely, the
  supernatural appearances, and other circumstances of a ghostly nature,
  that are said to invariably precede a death in many time-honoured
  families of the united kingdoms.</p>

  <p>We have all heard of the mysterious "White Ladye," that heralds the
  approach of death, or dire calamity, to the royal house of Hohenzollern.
  In like manner, the apparition of two gigantic owls upon the battlements
  of Wardour is said to give sad warning to the noble race of Arundel. The
  ancient Catholic family of Middleton have the same fatal announcement
  made to them by the spectral visitation of a Benedictine nun; while a
  Cheshire house of note, I believe, that of Brereton, are prepared for the
  last sad hour by the appearance of large trunks of trees floating in a
  lake in the immediate vicinity of their family mansion. To two families
  of venerable antiquity, and both, if I remember right, of the county of
  Lancashire, the approaching death of a relative is made known in one case
  by loud and continued knockings at the hall door at the solemn hour of
  midnight; and in the other, by strains of wild and unearthly music
  floating in the air.</p>

  <p>The "Banshee," well known in Ireland, and in the highlands of
  Scotland, is, I believe, attached exclusively to families of Celtic
  origin, and is never heard of below the Grampian range; although the
  ancient border house of Kirkpatrick of Closeburn (of Celtic blood by the
  way) is said to be attended by a familiar of this kind.</p>

  <p>Again, many old manor-houses are known to have been haunted by a
  friendly, good-natured sprite, ycelpt a "Brownie," whose constant care it
  was to save the household domestics as much trouble as possible, by doing
  all their drudgery for them during the silent hours of repose. Who has
  not heard, for instance, of the "Boy of Hilton?" Of this kindly race, I
  have no doubt, many interesting anecdotes might be rescued from the dust
  of time and oblivion, and preserved for us in the pages of "N. &amp;
  Q."</p>

  <p>I hope that the hints I have ventured to throw out may induce some of
  your talented contributors to follow up the subject.</p>

<h3>THE SCARLET REGIMENTALS OF THE ENGLISH ARMY.</h3>

  <p>When was the English soldier first dressed in red? It has been said
  the yeomen of the guard (<i>vulgo</i> Beef-eaters) were the company which
  originally wore that coloured uniform; but, seventy years before they
  were established, viz. temp. Henry V., it appears the military uniform of
  his army was red:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rex vestit suos <i>rubro</i>, et parat transire in
  Normaniam."&mdash;<i>Archæolog. Soc. Antiquar.</i>, Lond., vol. xxi. p.
  292.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>William III. not only preferred that colour, but he thought it
  degrading to the dignity of his soldiers that the colour should be
  adopted for the dress of any inferior class of persons; and there is an
  order now extant, signed by Henry, sixths Duke of Norfolk, as Earl
  Marshal, dated Dec. 20, 1698,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Forbidding any persons to use for their liveries scarlet or red
  cloth, or stuff; except his Majesty's servants and <i>guards</i>, and
  those belonging to the royal family or foreign Misters."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>William IV., who had as much of true old English feeling as any
  monarch who ever swayed the English sceptre, ordered scarlet to be the
  universal colour of our Light Dragoons; but two or three years afterwards
  he was prevailed upon, from some fancy of those about him, to return to
  the blue again. Still, it is well known that dressing our Light Dragoons
  in the colour prevailing <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  mistakes in time of action.</p>

  but dirt, mildew, and ill usage have rendered nearly all the inscriptions

  2 vols., entitled <i>L'Histoire des Imaginations Extavagantes de Monsieur
  Oufle</i>, is the best, as it contains some curious illustrations. From
  the title-page we learn that the work was "Occasioned by the author
  having read books treating of magic, the black art, demoniacs, conjurors,
  witches, hobgoblins, incubuses, succubuses, and the diabolical Sabbath;
  of elves, fairies, wanton spirits, geniuses, spectres, and ghosts; of
  dreams, the philosopher's stone, judicial astrology, horoscopes,
  talismans, lucky and unlucky days, eclipses, comets, and all sorts of
  apparitions, divinations, charms, enchantments, and other superstitious
  practices; with notes containing a multitude of quotations out of those
  books which have either caused such extravagant imaginations, or may
  serve to cure them." If any of our readers should feel inclined to
  collect what we may term "A Diabolical Library," he has only to consult
  vol. i. ch. iii. for a catalogue of the principal books in Mons. Oufle's

<h3>HOBY FAMILY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 19.)</p>

  <p>Many years have passed away since I went over Bisham Abbey; but I was
  then informed that any family portraits belonging to the old House had
  been taken away by the widow of Sir John Hoby Mill, Baronet, who sold the
  property to Mr. George Vansittart in 1780, or shortly afterwards. I am
  not aware that there are any engraved portraits of the Hobys, excepting
  those mentioned by your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr.
  Whitborne</span>, which form part of the series of Holbein's
  <i>Heads</i>, published in 1792 by John Chamberlaine, from the original
  drawings still in the royal collection. In the meagre account of the
  persons represented in that work, Lady Hoby is described as "Elizabeth,
  one of the four daughters of Sir Antony Cooke, of Gidea Hall, Essex," and
  widow of Sir Thomas Hoby, who died in 1566, at Paris, whilst on an
  embassy there. The lady remarried John Lord Russell, eldest son of
  Francis, second Earl of Bedford, whom she also survived, and deceasing
  23rd of July, 1584, was buried in Bisham Church, in which she had erected
  a chapel containing splendid monuments to commemorate her husbands and
  herself. The inscriptions will be found in Ashmole's <i>Berkshire</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 464., and in Wotton's <i>Baronetage</i>, vol. iv. p. 504.,
  where the Hoby crest is given as follows; "On a chapeau gules turned up
  ermine, a wolf regreant argent." The armorial bearings are described very
  minutely in Edward Steele's Account of Bisham Church, Gough MSS., vol.
  xxiv., Bodleian, which contains some other notices of the parish.</p>

<h3>POETICAL TAVERN SIGNS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 242. 452. 626.)</p>

  <p>I send two specimens from this neighbourhood, which may, perhaps, be
  worth inserting in your columns.</p>

  <p>The first is from a public-house on the Basingstoke road, about two
  miles from this town. The sign-board exhibits on one side "the lively
  effigies" of a grenadier in full uniform, holding in his hand a foaming
  pot of ale, on which he gazes apparently with much complacency and
  satisfaction. On the other side are these lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This is the Whitley Grenadier,</p>
      <p>A noted house for famous beer.</p>
      <p>My friend, if you should chance to call,</p>
      <p>Beware and get not drunk withal;</p>
      <p>Let moderation be your guide,</p>
      <p>It answers well whene'er 'tis try'd.</p>
      <p>Then use but not abuse strong beer,</p>
      <p>And don't forget the Grenadier."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The next specimen, besides being of a higher class, has somewhat of an
  historical interest. In a secluded part of the Oxfordshire hills, at a
  place called Collins's End, situated between Hardwick House and Goring
  Heath, is a neat little rustic inn, having for its sign a well-executed
  portrait of Charles I. There is a tradition that this unfortunate
  monarch, while residing as a prisoner at Caversham, rode one day,
  attended by an escort, into this part of the country, and hearing that
  there was a bowling-green at this inn, frequented by the neighbouring
  gentry, struck down to the house, and endeavoured to forget his sorrows
  for awhile in a game at bowls. This circumstance is alluded to in the
  following lines, which are written beneath the sign-board:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Stop, traveller, stop; in yonder peaceful glade,</p>
      <p>His favourite game the royal martyr play'd;</p>
      <p>Here, stripp'd of honours, children, freedom, rank,</p>
      <p>Drank from the bowl, and bowl'd for what he drank;</p>
      <p>Sought in a cheerful glass his cares to drown,</p>
      <p>And changed his guinea, ere he lost his crown."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sign, which seems to be a copy from Vandyke, though much faded
  from exposure to the weather, evidently displays an amount of artistic
  skill that is not usually to be found among common sign-painters. I once
  made some inquiries about it of the people of the house, but the only
  information they could give me was that they believed it to have been
  painted in London.</p>

<h3>FLORINS AND THE ROYAL ARMS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 621.)</p>

  <p>The placing of the royal arms in four separate shields in the form of
  a cross first occurred upon the medals struck upon the nativity of King
  Charles II., anno 1630; and adopted upon the reverse of the coins for the
  first time in 1662, upon the issue of what was then termed the improved
  milled coin, where the arms are so placed, having the star of the Garter
  in the centre; the crowns intersecting the legend, and two crowns
  interlaced in each quarter. The shields, as here marshalled, are each
  surmounted by a crown; having in the top and bottom shield France and
  England quarterly, Ireland on the dexter side (which is the second
  place), and on the sinister Scotland.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> But on the milled money which
  followed, France and England being borne separately, that of France,
  which had been constantly borne in the first quarter singly until James
  I., and afterwards in the first place quarterly with England, is placed
  in the bottom shield or fourth quarter. Mr. Leake, in his <i>Historical
  Account of English Money</i><a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, after remarking that this irregular
  bearing first appeared upon the nativity medals of Charles II. in 1630,
  where the shields are placed in this manner, adds, that this was no doubt
  originally owing to the ignorance of the graver, who knew no other way to
  place the arms circularly than following each other, like the titles,
  unless (as I have heard, says he) that the arms of each kingdom might
  fall under the respective title in the legend; and this witty conceit has
  ever since prevailed upon the coin, except in some of King William and
  Queen Mary's money, where the arms are rightly marshalled in one shield.
  That this was owing to the ignorance of the workman, and not with any
  design to alter the disposition of the arms, is evident from the arms
  upon the great seal, where France is borne quarterly with England, in the
  first and fourth quarters, as it was likewise used upon all other
  occasions, until the alteration occasioned by the union with Scotland in
  1707.</p>

  <p>In reference to the arrangement consequent upon the union with
  Scotland, he observes that, how proper soever the impaling the arms of
  the two kingdoms was in other respects, it appeared with great
  impropriety upon the money. The four escocheons in cross had hitherto
  been marshalled in their circular order from the <i>left</i>, whereby the
  dexter escocheon was the fourth; according to which order the united
  arms, being quartered first and fourth, would have fallen together;
  therefore they were placed at the top and bottom, <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>which indeed was right:
  but then France by the same rule was then in the third place, and Ireland
  in the second; unless to reconcile it we make a rule contrary to all
  rule, to take sinister first and dexter second.</p>

  <p>In the coinage of King George I., the representation of the armorial
  bearings in four separate shields, as upon the milled money of King
  Charles II., was continued. In the uppermost escocheon, England impaling
  Scotland; the dexter the arms of his Majesty's electoral dominions;
  sinister France; and in the bottom one Ireland, all crowned with the
  imperial crown of Great Britain. The marshalling of the four escocheon's
  in this manner might and ought to have been objected to by the heralds
  (has it been brought under their cognizance?), because it appears by many
  instances, as well as upon coins and medals of the emperors and several
  princes of the entire, that arms marshalled in this circular form are
  blazoned, not in the circular order, but from the dexter and sinister
  alternately; and thus the emperor at that time bore eleven escocheons
  round the imperial eagle. In like manner, upon the money of Henry Julius,
  Duke of Brunswick, we see the crest with a circle of eleven escocheons in
  the same order. The same order is observed in marshalling the escocheons
  of the seven provinces of Holland and there is a coin of the Emperor
  Ferdinand, another of Gulick, and a third of Erick, Bishop of Osnaburgh,
  with four escocheons in cross, and four sceptres exactly resembling the
  English coins. That it was not altered therefore at that time, the
  mistake being so evident, can be attributed only to the length of time
  the error had prevailed; so hard is it to correct an error in the first
  instance whereby the arms of his Majesty's German dominions, which occupy
  the fourth quarter in the royal arms, do in fact upon the money occupy
  the second place; a mistake however so apparent, as well by the bearing
  upon other occasions as by the areas of Ireland, which before occupied
  the same escocheon, that nothing was meant thereby to the dishonour of
  the other arms; but that being now established, it is the English method
  of so marshalling arms in cross or circle, or rather that they have no
  certain method.</p>

  <p>Until the union with Scotland, the dexter was the fourth escocheon;
  from that time the bottom one was fourth; now the dexter was again the
  fourth. Such is the force of precedent in perpetuating error, that the
  practice has prevailed even to the present time and it may be inferred,
  that fancy and effect are studied by the engraver before propriety. No
  valid reason can be advanced for placing the arms in <i>separate</i>
  shields after their declared union under one imperial crown.</p>

<h3>OATHS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 364. 471.)</p>

  <p>In Primate Colton's <i>Metropolitan Visitation of the Diocese of
  Derry</i>, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1397, edited by the Rev. William
  Reeves, D.D., it is stated, at p. 44., that several persons therein
  mentioned took their oath "tactis sacrosanctis Evangeliis;" and in a note
  Dr. Reeves says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Until the arrival of the English the custom of swearing on the holy
  evangelists was unknown to the Irish, who resorted instead to croziers,
  bells, and other sacred reliquaries, to give solemnity to their
  declarations. Even when the Gospels were used, it was not uncommon to
  introduce some other object to render the oath doubly binding. Thus in a
  monition directed by Primate Prene to O'Neill, he requires him to be
  sworn 'tactis sacrosanctis Dei evangeliis ad ea, et super Baculum Jesu in
  ecclesia cathedrali Sanctæ Trinitatis Dublin.' (<i>Reg. Prene</i>, fol.
  117.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following lines upon the subject in question will be found in the
  <i>Red Book</i> of the Irish Exchequer:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Qui jurat super librum tria tacit.</p>

  <p>"Primo quasi diceret omnia que scripta sunt in hoc libro nunquam mihi
  perficiant neque lex nova neque vetus si mencior in hoc juramento.</p>

  <p>"Secundo apponit manum super librum quasi diceret numquam bona opera
  que feci michi proficiant ante faciem Jeshu Christi nisi veritatem dicam
  quando per manus significentur opera.</p>

  <p>"Tercio et ultimo osculatur librum quasi diceret numquam oraciones
  neque preces quas dixi per os meum michi ad salutem anime valeant si
  falsitatem dicam in hoc juramento michi apposito."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Judging by the character of the handwriting, I would say that the
  above-mentioned lines were written not later than the time of Edward I.;
  and as many of the vellum leaves of this book have been sadly disfigured,
  as well by the pressure of lips as by tincture of galls, I am inclined to
  think that official oaths were formerly taken in the Court of Exchequer
  of Ireland by presenting the book when opened to the person about to be
  sworn in the manner at this day used (as we are informed by Honoré de
  Mareville) in the Ecclesiastical Court at Guernsey.</p>

  <p>It appears by an entry in one of the Order Books of the Exchequer,
  deposited in the Exchequer Record Office, Four Courts, Dublin, that in
  James I.'s time the oath of allegiance was taken upon bended knee. The
  entry to which I refer is in the following words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Easter Term, Wednesday, 22nd April, 1618.</i>&mdash;Memorandum:
  This day at first sitting of the court, the lord threasurer, vice
  threasurer, and all the barons being present on the bench, the lord
  chauncellor came hither and presented before them Thomas Hibbotts, esq.,
  with his Majesty's letters patents of the office of chauncellor of this
  court to him graunted, to hold and execute the said office during his
  naturall life, which being read the said lord chauncellor first ministred
  unto him the oath of the King's supremacy, which hee tooke kneeling on
  his knee, and presently after ministred unto him the oath ordayned for
  the said officer, as the same is contayned of record in the redd booke of
  this court; all which being donn the said lord chauncellor placed him on
  the bench on the right hand of the lord threasurer, and then departed
  this court."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Splitting Paper for Photographic Purposes.</i>&mdash;If the real
  and practical mode of effecting this were disclosed, it would be (in many
  cases) a valuable aid to the photographer. I have had many negative
  calotypes ruined by red stains on the back (but not affecting the
  impressed side of the paper); which, could the paper <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>have been split,
  would in all probability have been available, and printed well.</p>

  <p>I was sorry to see in "N. &amp; Q" (Vol. iii., p. 604.) an article
  under this head which went the round of the papers several months ago.
  Anything more impracticable and ridiculously absurd than the directions
  there given can hardly be imagined: "cylinders of amber!" or "cylinders
  of <i>metallic</i> amalgam!!" "excited in the usual manner," &amp;c. I
  presume <i>electrical</i> excitation is intended. Though, how cylinders
  of <i>metal</i> are to receive electrical <i>excitation</i>, and to have
  sufficient attractive power over a sheet of paper as to rend it asunder,
  would be a problem which I believe even a Faraday could not solve:
  neither would excited glass cylinders effect the object any better; or if
  they could, it would be erecting a wheel to break a fly upon.</p>

  <p>The whole proposition must originally have been a hoax: in fact, we
  live in a day when the masses of the people are easily induced to believe
  that <i>electricity</i> can <i>do everything</i>.</p>

  <p>Another, and far more feasible plan has been proposed ("N. &amp; Q.,"
  Vol. viii., p. 413.), viz. to paste the paper to be split between two
  pieces of calico or linen; and when perfectly dry, part them. One half,
  it is said, will adhere to each piece of the linen, and may afterwards be
  obtained or set free from the linen by soaking.</p>

  <p>I have tried this with partial, but not satisfactory success. It will
  be remembered that the <i>results</i> of the <i>true</i> process were
  some years ago exhibited before a scientific company (I think at the
  Royal Institution), when a page of the <i>London Illustrated News</i> was
  first exhibited in its usual condition, printed on both sides; and was
  then taken to an adjoining apartment, and in a short time (perhaps a
  quarter of an hour) re-exhibited to the company split into two laminæ,
  each being perfect. Neither the <i>pasting</i> plan, nor the electrical
  gammon, could have effected this. I hope some of your readers (they are a
  legion) will confer on photographers the favour of informing them of this
  art.</p>

  <p><i>Curling of Iodized Paper.</i>&mdash;The difficulty which your
  correspondent C. E. F. has met with, in iodizing paper according to <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> valuable and simple process, may be
  easily obviated.</p>

  <p>I experienced the same annoyance of "curling up" till it was suggested
  to me to damp the paper previously to floating it. I have since always
  adopted this expedient, and find it answer perfectly. The method I employ
  for damping it is to leave it for a few hours previously to using it upon
  the bricks in my cellar: and I have no doubt but that, if C. E. F. will
  try the same plan, he will be equally satisfied with the result.</p>

  <p class="author">W. F. W.</p>

  <p><i>How the Glass Rod is used.</i>&mdash;Would you be kind enough to
  inform me how paper is prepared or excited with the glass rod in the
  calotype process? Is the solution first poured on the paper, and then
  equally diffused over it with the rod?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Duthus.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The manner in which the glass rod is to be used for exciting or
  developing is very simple, although not easily described. The operator
  must provide himself with some pieces of thin board, somewhat larger than
  the paper intended to be used; on one of these two or three folds of
  blotting-paper are to be laid, and on these the paper intended to be
  excited, and which is to be kept steady by pins at the top and bottom
  right-hand corners, and the forefinger of the left hand. The operator,
  having ready in a small measure about thirty drops of the exciting fluid,
  takes the glass rod in his right hand, moves it steadily over the paper
  from the right hand to the left, where he keeps it, while with the left
  hand he pours the exciting fluid over the side of the glass rod, and
  moving this <i>to and fro</i> once or twice to secure an equal portion of
  the exciting fluid along the whole length of the rod; he then moves the
  rod from left to right and back again, until he has ascertained that the
  whole surface is covered, taking care that none of the exciting fluid
  runs over the side of the paper, as it is then apt to discolour the back
  of it. When the whole surface has been thoroughly wetted, the superfluous
  fluid is to be blotted off with a piece of new blotting-paper.]</p>

  <p><i>Wooden Tombs and Effigies</i> (Vol. viii., p. 604.).&mdash;In
  addition to that mentioned by J. E. J., there is a wooden chest in the

  figure in plated armour on the top; the head resting on a helmet
  supported by two angels, and at the feet a lion crowned. An ornament of
  oak leaves runs round the chest, at the edge. This effigy is supposed to
  represent one of the Cornwall family, the ancient, but now extinct,
  barons of Burford. As I am preparing, with a view to publication, a
  history of this very ancient family, with an account of the curious and

  <p>May I append a Query to my reply? Was <i>The Nightingale</i> published
  with a frontispiece? My copy is mutilated, but has belonged to some
  person who valued it much more highly than I do, as he has neatly
  repaired and replaced torn leaves and noted deficiencies. Prefixed is a
  mounted engraving of a bird in the act of singing, which, if intended for
  a nightingale, is really curious; as it is of the size and shape of a
  pheasant, with corvine legs and beak, and a wattle round the eye like
  that of a barb pigeon. The book is "printed and sold by J. Osborn," and
  shows that the post assigned to him in <i>The Dunciad</i> was not worse
  than he deserved.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Our correspondent seems to have the veritable original engraving; the
  nightingale or pheasant, or whatever it may he, is mounted on a branch
  over a stream near to three houses, and a village on its banks is seen in
  the distance.]</p>

  <p><i>Sneezing</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 366. 624.).&mdash;To the very
  interesting illustrations given by Mr. Francis Scott of the ancient
  superstitions associated with sternutation, I should like to add one not
  less curious than any which he has given. It is recorded in Xenophon's
  <i>Anabasis</i>, lib. iii. cap. 2.</p>

  <p>At the council of Greek generals, held after the death of Cyrus,
  Xenophon rose and made a speech. He set before his comrades the treachery
  of their late associate Ariæus; the serious difficulties attendant upon
  the position of the Greeks; and the necessity for immediate and vigorous
  action. Just as he had alluded to the probability of a severe conflict,
  and had invoked the aid of the gods, one of the company <i>sneezed</i>.
  He paused for a moment in his harangue, and every one present did
  reverence (<span title="prosekonêsan" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&epsilon;&kappa;&#x1F79;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&alpha;&nu;</span>)
  to Jupiter. The circumstance seemed to give new spirit and fortitude to
  the whole assembly; and when Xenophon resumed, he said, "Even now, my
  comrades, while we were talking of safety, Zeus the saviour has sent us
  an omen; and I think it would become us to offer to the god a sacrifice
  of thanksgiving for our preservation." He then, in the manner of a modern
  chairman at Exeter Hall, invited all of that opinion to hold up their
  hands. This appeal having met a unanimous response, they all made their
  vows, sung the pæan, and the orator proceeded with his discourse.</p>

  <p>The adoration of the god, or the use of some auspicious words or
  religious formulary, appears to have been designed to avert any evil
  which might possibly be portended by the omen. It seems by no means
  certain that it was always regarded as favourable. Xenophon, in the case
  referred to, contrived very adroitly to turn the incident to good
  account, and to interpret it as a sign of the divine favour. The form of
  one of the sentences I have translated&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Does "Wurm," in modern German, ever mean Serpent?</i> (Vol. viii
  pp. 465. 624.).&mdash;F. W. J. is quite right as regards his
  interpretation of the word <i>Wurm</i>, used by Schiller in his
  <i>Wallenstein</i> in the passage spoken by Butler.</p>

  <p><i>Wurm</i> is not used in German to mean a serpent. Serpents
  (<i>Schlangen</i>) are vertebrata, and are therefore not confounded with
  <i>Würmer</i> by the Germans. The language of the people frames proverbs,
  not the language of science. The Germans apply the word <i>Wurm</i> to
  express pity or contempt. The mother says to her sick child, "Armes
  <i>Würmchen</i>!" signifying poor, suffering, little creature. Man to
  man, in order to express contempt, will say "Elender <i>Wurm</i>!"
  meaning miserable wretch; an application arising out of the contemplation
  of the helpless state and inferior construction of this division of the
  animal kingdom. The German proverb corresponds to the English.</p>

  <p><i>Longfellow's Reaper and the Flowers</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  583.).&mdash;This charge of plagiarism, I think, is not a substantial
  one. To compare Death to a reaper, and children to flowers, is a very
  general idea, and may be thought by thousands, and <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>expressed in nearly the
  same words which Longfellow, and before him Luisa Reichardt, have used.
  The first line of the two respective poems are certainly word for word
  the same, but that is all; although the tendency of both poems is the
  same. Longfellow's poem is much superior to that of L. Reichardt; for,
  while the former has a beautiful clothing, colouring, and harmony, the
  latter is very crude, poor, and defective. Longfellow's long residence in
  Germany has indeed rendered him very susceptible to the form and spirit
  of German poetry, and hence there exist in his poems frequently
  affinities as to general forms and ideas: still, affinities arising from
  such causes cannot justly be termed plagiarism, much less the accidental
  choice of a very widely existent, natural thought. When Byron wrote his
  opening line to <i>The Bride of Abydos</i>, he did not probably think of
  Göthe's</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Könnst du das Land wo die Citronen blühen?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Byron was not a German scholar; and as the opening line is the only
  analogy between the two poems, we may justly believe it natural for any
  one who has lived in southern lands, to ask such a question. The charge
  of plagiarism, I think, ought to rest upon grounds which evince an actual
  copying.</p>

  <p><i>Charge of Plagiarism against Paley</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  589.).&mdash;As a personal friend of the gentleman who, under the name of
  <span class="sc">Veritas</span>, brought, about five years ago, a charge
  of plagiarism against Paley, I feel called upon to say few words to <span
  class="sc">Fiat Just.</span></p>

  <p>Truth cannot be refuted, and F. J. may look at the translation of the
  old Dutch book of Nieuwentyt's, which he will find in the British Museum
  library, the same place where <span class="sc">Veritas</span> made the
  discovery while examining the works of some continental metaphysicians:
  and <span class="sc">Fiat Just.</span> will then no doubt regret having
  made the rash and illogical observation, "that the accusation be refuted,
  <i>or</i> the culprit consigned to that contempt," &amp;c. The character
  of <span class="sc">Veritas</span> as man, moralist, and scholar, does
  not deserve so unjust and rash a remark.</p>

  <p>The Dutch book, as well as the translation, are very scarce. Five and
  six copies of the latter could only be found at the time of the discovery
  in London.</p>

  <p><i>Tin</i> (Vol. viii., p. 593.).&mdash;The suggestions of your
  correspondent S. G. C. are ingenious respecting the etymology of
  <i>Cassiteros</i>, but a slight examination will show they are erroneous.
  The Cassi was only one of the many tribes inhabiting Britain in the time
  of Cæsar, and it is by no means probable that it was able to confer its
  name upon the entire country, to the exclusion of all the rest; such as
  the Iceni, the Trinobanti, the Coritani, the Belgæ, and various others
  too numerous to mention. We must bear in mind that the Ph&oelig;nicians
  gave the name of Cassiterides to the British Isles; and that in naming
  places they invariably called them after some known or supposed quality
  possessed by them, or from some natural appearance which first arrested
  their notice: and such was the case in this instance. We learn that it
  was the common belief in ancient times, that the islands to the west of
  Europe were shrouded in almost perpetual gloom and darkness; hence the
  British Isles were called Cassiterides, from <i>Ceas</i>, pronounced
  <i>Kass</i>, i. e. gloom, darkness, obscurity; and <i>tir</i>, i. e.
  lands, plural <i>Ceasiterides</i>, i. e. "the islands of darkness." And
  the tin which the Ph&oelig;nicians procured from them received the
  appropriate name of Cassiteros, <i>i. e.</i> the metal from the islands
  of darkness.</p>

  <p><i>Dog-whipping Day in Hull</i> (Vol. viii., p. 409.).&mdash;This
  custom obtains, or used to do, in York on St. Luke's Day, Oct. 18, which
  is there known by the name of "Whip-dog Day." Drake considers the origin
  of it uncertain and though he is of opinion that it is a very old custom,
  he does not <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>agree with those who date it as far back as
  the Romans.</p>

  <p>In the <i>History of York</i>, vol. i. p. 306., respecting the author
  of which a Query has appeared in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 125., the
  traditional account of its origin is given:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That in times of Popery, a priest celebrating mass at the festival in
  some church in York, unfortunately dropped the pix after consecration,
  which was snatched up suddenly and swallowed by a dog that lay under the
  table. The profanation of this high mystery occasioned the death of the
  dog; and a persecution began, and has since continued on this day (St.
  Luke's), to be severely carried on against all the species in the
  city."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A very curious whipping custom prevails at Leicester, known by the
  name of "Whipping Toms," on the afternoon of Shrove Tuesday. It is thus
  described in Hone's <i>Year Book</i>, p. 539.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In this space (the Newark) several (I think three) men called
  'Whipping Toms,' each being armed with a large waggon whip, and attended
  by another man carrying a bell, claim the right of flogging every person
  whom they can catch while their attendant bell-man can keep ringing his
  bell."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps some one of your correspondents will be able to afford an
  origin for this odd usage.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">R. W. Elliot.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Clifton.</p>

  <p>A Spanish lady now resident in England, a member of the Latin Church,
  mentioned to me, some months since, a custom prevailing in her native
  land similar to that in Hull described by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Richardson</span>. It arose on this wise: Once upon a time, on a high
  festival of the Church, when there was an exposition of the blessed
  Sacrament, a dog rushed into the church when the altar was unguarded, and
  carried off the Host. This deed of the sacrilegious animal filled the
  Spaniards with such horror, that ever after, on the anniversary of that
  day, all dogs were beaten and stoned that showed themselves in the
  streets.</p>

  <p><i>Mousehunt</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 516. 606.).&mdash;I think the
  inquiry relative to this animal may be satisfactorily answered by the
  following quotation from a very excellent and learned work, entitled <i>A
  Natural History of British and Foreign Quadrupeds, containing many
  Original Observations and Anecdotes</i>, by James H. Fennell, 8vo.,
  London, 1841:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Beech Marten is the <i>Martes foina</i> of modern zoologists, the
  <i>Martes Fagorum</i> of Ray, the <i>Martes Saxorum</i> of Klein, the
  <i>Mustela Martes</i> of Linnæus, and the <i>Mustela foina</i> of Gmelin.
  Its English synonymes are not less numerous; for, besides Beech Marten,
  it is called Stone Marten, Martern, Marteron, Martlett, and
  <i>Mousehunt</i>. The last name I insert on the authority of Henley, thee
  dramatic commentator, who says it is the animal to which 'charming Willie
  Shakspeare' thus alludes in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg1">'<i>Capulet.</i> I have watch'd ere now</p>
      <p>All night&mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Lady Capulet.</i> Ay, thou have been a <i>mouse-hunt</i> in</p>
      <p class="i2">your time.'&mdash;Act IV. Sc. 4.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"In Knight's <i>Pictorial Edition of Romeo and Juliet</i> (1839), this
  and many other terms equally requiring explanation are left quite
  unelucidated; though one picture of this said <i>mouse-hunt</i> would
  doubtless have been more assistant to the professed object of the work
  than the two unnecessary pictures it contains of certain winged
  monstrosities called Cupids."&mdash;P. 106.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Fennell goes on to state, that the Beech Marten (<i>alias</i>
  Mousehunt) inhabits the woods and forests of most parts of Europe, seldom
  quitting them except in its nocturnal excursions; and he adds
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The <i>Beech Marten</i> does sometimes, in the Highlands of Scotland,
  where it is common, and called <i>Tuggin</i>, take to killing lambs, and
  makes sad havoc. Luckily, however, it is nearly exterminated in the south
  of that country. In Selkirkshire, it has been observed to descend to the
  shore at night time to feed upon mollusks, particularly upon the large
  Basket Mussel (<i>Mytilus modiolus</i>). But the ordinary prey of both
  this and the Pine Marten appears to the hares, rabbits, squirrels, moles,
  rats, <i>mice</i>; game birds; turkeys, pigeons, and other domestic
  poultry, and also the wild singing birds."&mdash;P. 109.</p>

  <p>In the above work Mr. Fennell has given many other interesting
  zoological elucidations of Shakspeare, and of various other ancient
  poets.</p>

  <p><i>St. Paul's School Library</i> (Vol. viii., p. 641.).&mdash;A
  catalogue of the library was privately printed in 1836, 8vo. It is
  nominally under the care of the captain of the school, who, having his
  own duties to attend to, cannot be expected to pay much attention to it:
  this readily accounts for the disorder said to prevail.</p>

  <p>It is believed to contain the copy of <i>Vegetius de re militari</i>,
  the perusal of which by Marlborough, when a pupil at the school, imbued
  him with that love for military science he in after-life so successfully
  cultivated.</p>

  <p>It would be a good deed on the part of the wealthy company, the
  trustees of Colet's noble foundation, to enlarge the library and pay a
  salary to a librarian; it might thus become a useful appendage to the
  school, and under certain regulations be made accessible to the
  vicinity.</p>

  <p><i>German Tree</i> (Vol. viii., p. 619.).&mdash;In answer to the
  inquiry of <span class="sc">Zeus</span>, who wishes to be informed
  whether this custom was known in England previous to 1836, I beg to refer
  him to Coleridge's <i>Friend</i>, second landing-place, essay iii. (vol.
  ii. <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>p. 249.), entitled "Christmas within doors
  in the north of Germany." The passage (apparently from Coleridge's
  journal) is dated "Ratzeburg, 1799." It is, I think, also extracted in
  Knight's <i>Half-hours with the best Authors</i>. Coleridge went to
  Germany in 1798 (<i>Biog. Lit.</i>, vol. i. p. 211. note); but I imagine
  the passage I refer to did not appear till 1818, when <i>The Friend</i>
  was published in three volumes (<i>Biog. Lit.</i>, vol. ii. p. 420.). As
  the book is so common, I do not think it worth while to copy out the
  account. <span class="sc">Zeus</span> has by this time, I hope, had a
  Christmas Yggdrasil in his Olympus.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of the Word "Cash"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 386.).&mdash;May

  as being&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The smallest coin in the world, there being about 1000 to 1500 (cash)
  in a dollar, <i>i. e.</i> one-fifth to one-seventh of a farthing."</p>

  <p>If I am not mistaken, the coin in question is perforated in the centre
  to permit numbers of the pieces being strung together, payments being
  made in so many strings of cash.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p><i>The Poetical Works of John Dryden</i>, edited by Robert Bell, Vol.
  I., is the first of what is proposed to be a revised and carefully
  annotated edition of the English Poets, which is intended to supply what
  the publisher believes to be an existing want, namely, "a Complete Body
  of English Poetry, edited throughout with judgment and integrity, and
  combining those features of research, typographical elegance, and economy
  of price, which the present age demands." Certainly, half-a-crown a
  volume fulfils the latter requirement in an extraordinary manner; and
  there can be little doubt that if the other essentials be as strictly
  fulfilled, and the collection embraces, as it is intended, not only the
  works of several poets who have been entirely omitted from previous
  collections, but those stores of lyrical and ballad poetry in which our
  literature is so preeminently rich, <i>The Annotated Edition of the
  English Poets</i> will meet with that extensive sale to which alone the
  publisher can look for remuneration.</p>

  <p><i>The Museum of Science and Art</i>, edited by Dr. Lardner, is
  intended to supply a collection of instructive tracts and essays,
  composed in a popular and amusing style, and in easy language, on the
  leading discoveries in the Physical Sciences: so that persons, whose
  occupations exclude the possibility of systematic study, may in their
  short hours of leisure obtain a considerable amount of information on
  subjects of the highest interest. This design is extremely well carried
  out in the first four numbers, which are devoted to&mdash;I. and II. The
  Planets: Are they Inhabited Worlds? III. Weather Prognostics; and IV.
  Popular Fallacies. The introduction of details and incidents, which could
  not with propriety be introduced into works of a purely scientific
  character, give great variety and interest to the different papers.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>The Journal of Sacred
  Literature</i>, New Series, No. X., contains, in addition to its notes,
  correspondence, &amp;c., no less than twelve papers of varied interest to
  the peculiar class of readers to whom this periodical expressly addresses
  itself.&mdash;Mr. Bohn has just added to his <i>Standard Library</i> a
  collection of the <i>Novels and Tales of Göthe</i>, comprising his
  <i>Elective Affinities; The Sorrows of Werther; German Emigrants; Good
  Women; and a Nouvelette</i>: and in his <i>Classical Library</i> he has
  commenced a revised edition of the Oxford translation of <i>Tacitus</i>.
  The Ninth Part of Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography</i>,
  which extends from the conclusion of the article <i>Germania</i> to
  <i>Hytanis</i>, concludes the first volume of this admirable addition to
  Dr. Smith's series of Classical Dictionaries.&mdash;<i>Cyclopædia
  Bibliographica</i>, Part XVI., from <i>Platina</i> to <i>Rivet</i>. Every
  additional Part confirms our opinion of the great utility of this
  indispensable library companion.</p>

  <p>"Sir,</p>

  <p>"An extremely clever and interesting review of Pineton de Chambrun's
  <i>History of the Persecutions of the Protestants by the French King in
  the Principality of Orange</i> appeared in the <i>Journal des Débats</i>
  of the 30th Nov. last. This article is dated from the British Museum (in
  the reading room of which establishment it may very probably have been
  written), and signed <i>William Jones</i>. As I am the only person in the
  British Museum bearing the surname of Jones, the article has been
  attributed to me, in very courteous terms, by a correspondent of the "N.

  <p>REDUCTION IN PRICE of FRENCH PAPERS prepared for MONS. LE GRAY'S

  hitherto charged for the same description, is respectfully solicited,
  combined with a hope that, as the most careful Selection and Chemical
  Manipulation has been observed, the endeavour (by reducing their cost) to
  extend this beautiful and already extensively applied branch of
  Photographic Art, may secure a portion of public patronage. Canson
  Frères' Waxed Negative, 6s. per quire; Iodised ditto, 8s. 6d.; Sensitive,
  available for three weeks, 13s. Size, 17½ by 11½, demy folio. Specimens

  peculiarly suited for reading aloud in families and to the sick, on
  account of their simple and affectionate style, and the interesting and
  practical manner in which religious truths are inculcated. The publisher
  desires to point out their usefulness in these respects, having reason to
  believe that their circulation has hitherto been chiefly among the
  clergy, and that they are still comparatively little known to the
  laity.</p>
